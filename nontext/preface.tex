\chapter{Preface}

\lettrine{T}{his} is a mathematical scrapyard of mathematical oddities that I have encountered, wrestled with, and eventually understood, often after hours of frustration.

There's no overarching theme beyond the fact these are mathematical things I find curious, beautiful and In here I'll add things I find curious, beautiful or just odd. Most of it is likely useless in a practical sense, existing only for the joy of the mechanism itself.
